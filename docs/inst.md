## Installation

To compile logfilegen from the source you need GCC/g++ or Clang with C++11 version support. If you did not compiled programs before, install g++ or Clang, and **make** utility to your system. Then, in the simplest case, run as root or with sudo, at the logfilegen source directory:


```console
make
make install
```

And to uninstall:


```console
make uninstall
```
