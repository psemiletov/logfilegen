What's new?
The new release is slighty faster. Two new macros were added: @meta and @seq. All of them are described at the documentation, here in a short - @meta allows to combine several macros into one, so we can use more than one macro at the simple (non-sequenced) variable value. And @seq can be used to use sequences at macro, as in the usual variable value.

Example 001:

$test=@seq:GET:PUT
$logstring=hello, $test

Example 002:

$test=@meta:foo (@str:12) bar (@int:12:16) (@ip)
$logstring=hello, $test
